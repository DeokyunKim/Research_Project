## Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)

To learn for Single image super-resolution using deep learning, I read the following typical papers related to SISR below and implemented in code.

## Translation from Near Infra-Red Image to RGB Image

I am trying to solve image translation from NIR Images to RGB Images.
The key question is

1. How can deep neural network infer the color information from NIR Images?

2. Following question is "shouldn't the same object be inferred from different colors, depending conditions such as weather and time?"

In addition, research so far has found that the deep neural network is biased into green(wood) and blue(sky) that make up the majority of the images.

## One-Shot Image Quality Enhancement

Visual correction of photographs is the domain of well-trained experts. I trained a deep neural network with noisy and well-corrected clean image by referring to the following papers. Because the noisy image is mostly dark, and clean image is mostly bright, I have found that the trained deep neural network makes the bright images much brighter. Thus, I trained the network by using the color-wise normalize method to robust the brightness of images.
